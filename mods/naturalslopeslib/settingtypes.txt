## Update shape ABM

# Enable or disable the automatic update of the shape of nodes at the surface (requires twmlib mod).

## Update shape on walk

# Enable or disable shape update when walking on blocks (requires poschangelib mod).
naturalslopeslib_enable_shape_on_walk (Enable shaping by walking on edges) bool true


## Update shape on world generation

# Enable or disable shape update when the world is generated.
# This will probably put a lot of pressure on the server. Hopefully it doesn't happen that frequently.

# Define which method is used when generating a new area.
#  - VoxelManip (default) is the most efficient one, but the area will be available only once it is completely updated and may be resource intensive. This is the preferred method as map generation is optimized not to impact the game.
#  - Progressive is way much slower, but the area is available directly in it's untransformed shape. The nodes will be updated one after the other while the game is rather idle. This method is preferred on old single core CPU that cannot benefit from map generation optimization, if the areas are too long to emerge or if you like to see mountains smoothing themselves progressively.

## Update shape on dig and place

# Enable or disable shape update of neighbor nodes when one is placed or updated.
naturalslopeslib_enable_shape_on_dig_place (Shape update on dig and place) bool true

## Revert changes

# Prevent new updates and revert slopes to their original block shape when they are loaded.
# Activate this function if you would like to deactivate natural slopes in existing worlds, but leave all the slopes mods loaded to prevent unknown nodes to appearing until all revert is done.
# Revert cannot be undone once blocks are loaded.
naturalslopeslib_revert (Revert) bool false

## Rendering

# Rendering mode for slopes. It only affects the visuals. The collision boxes are always matching the cubic style.
# Anything different from Cubic will shows sharp discontinuities between slopes and non-sloped nodes, and will mislead players because the bottom part of a slope is in fact half a node higher than it looks like.
# - Cubic (default) divides blocs in 8 and give stair-like look
# - Smooth uses smooth triangles.
# - Rough shows more accidented slopes.
